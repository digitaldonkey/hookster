# Source Files

Drop all of your WordPress theme or plugin's files into this directory and then run `npm run build` in your terminal.

**Important!** Remember to change the `namespace` parameter in the `package.json` file before running the script. Only actions and filters with your namespace will be scraped from your product's PHP files.
